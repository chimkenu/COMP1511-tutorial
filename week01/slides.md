Exercise #1
---

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->
<!-- list_item_newlines: 2 -->
1. List all the files in our current directory
    - `ls`
2. Create a directory called "test"
    - `mkdir test`
3. Move into the new directory
    - `cd test`
4. Create a new C file called "hello_world.c"
    - `touch hello_world.c`
5. Open "hello_world.c" in VSCode
    - `code hello_world.c`

C code features

<!-- end_slide -->

Exercise #2
---

Write a C program that prints the face:
```text
~ ~
0 0
 o
 -
```

<!-- pause -->

Then modify it to print the face:
```text
~ ~
0 0
 o
\_/
```

<!-- end_slide -->

Comments
---

- Two ways of commenting:
  - Anything after `//` is treated as a comment
  - Can start a multiline comment with `/*` and end it with `*/`
- Comments are ignored by the compiler
- Generally used to explain a piece of code

```c
// This is a single line comment

/* This is also a single line comment */

/*
This
Is
A
Multiline
Comment
*/
```

<!-- end_slide -->

Escape sequences
---

- `\` followed by a single character forms an "escape sequence"
- These have special meanings when printing
- Some common examples are:
  - `\n` - newline
  - `\\` - literal `\` character
  - `\t` - tab (differs from machine to machine)

```c +exec
/// #include <stdio.h>
/// int main(void) {
printf("new\nline\n");      // prints new
                            //        line
printf("tab\tcharacter\n"); // prints tab    character
printf("back\\slash\n");    // prints back\slash
/// }
```

<!-- end_slide -->

Main function
---

- Required for the program to compile and run
- For now every program you write should follow this structure

```c
// Header comment
// This should include your name, zid, date
// as well as a short description of the program

int main(void) {
    // Code here
    return 0;
}
```

<!-- end_slide -->

Exercise #2 Solution
---

```c {all|1-7|9|11,18|12-15|17|all}
// Face
// face.c
//
// This program was written by Marcus Alejo (z5559853)
// on 2025-07-27
//
// A simple C program that prints a smiley face!

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("~ ~\n");
    printf("0 0\n");
    printf(" o\n");
    printf("\\_/\n");

    return 0;
}
```

- You can find the lab questions on the course website.
    - Scroll down to `Laboratory`
    - Click on `Problem Set`
<!-- new_line -->
- When logging in for the first time, you might be given a popup.
    - Make sure to select `use default config`
<!-- new_line -->
- Labs are usually due the following `Monday at 6 pm`
    - e.g. Week 1 lab will be due Week 2 Monday 18:00
<!-- new_line -->
- Make sure you are familiar with how to submit your work! Details are given at the bottom of each exercise.
<!-- new_line -->
- First lab (week 1) is `not marked`, but week 2 onwards will be!

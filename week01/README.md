## C code features

### Comments

- Two ways of commenting:
  - Anything after `//` is treated as a comment
  - Can start a multiline comment with `/*` and end it with `*/`
- Comments are ignored by the compiler
- Generally used to explain a piece of code

```c
// This is a single line comment

/* This is also a single line comment */

/*
This
Is
A
Multiline
Comment
*/
```

### Escape sequences

- `\` followed by a single character forms an "escape sequence"
- These have special meanings when printing
- Some common examples are:
  - `\n` - newline
  - `\\` - literal `\` character
  - `\t` - tab (differs from machine to machine)

### Main function

- Required for the program to compile and run
- For now every program you write should follow this structure

```c
// Header comment
// This should include your name, zid, date
// as well as a short description of the program

int main(void) {
    // Code here
    return 0;
}
```
